# Tasktris

Tasktris is a productivity app that gamifies task management by integrating elements of the classic Tetris game. This project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack application using modern technologies while focusing on user experience and interactive design.

## Features

- **Task Gamification:** Transform tasks into Tetris pieces that fit into a customizable board.
- **Real-Time Progress Visualization:** Visualize productivity by completing rows on the Tetris board with tasks.
- **Customizable Boards:** Choose different difficulty levels and board sizes to tailor the app to individual productivity needs.
- **Progress Tracking:** Track and manage daily, weekly, and monthly productivity metrics.
- **Dark Mode:** A sleek UI with a dark mode for reduced eye strain and better focus.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React Native:** For building a cross-platform mobile application with a responsive UI.
- **TailwindCSS:** For rapid and consistent styling across the app.

### Backend

- **Appwrite:** A backend-as-a-service platform for user authentication, database management, and API integrations.

### Other Tools

- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for collaborative development and version management.
- **Design Tools:** Figma for prototyping the app's user interface.

## Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Gamification in Productivity Tools:** Implemented game mechanics to enhance user engagement and promote task completion.
2. **Full-Stack Development:** Successfully built an application from scratch using a full-stack development approach.
3. **User-Centric Design:** Focused on crafting an intuitive and visually appealing interface that caters to usersâ€™ needs.
4. **State Management:** Managed complex interactions between the game board and task list efficiently.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Ensured a seamless user experience by optimizing rendering and API calls.

## How It Works

1. **Task Input:** Users add tasks to their to-do list.
2. **Tetris Mechanics:** Each task corresponds to a Tetris piece, varying in size based on the task's difficulty.
3. **Board Completion:** Tasks are "completed" by fitting them into the Tetris board. Completing rows earns points and clears space for more tasks.
4. **Tracking Progress:** Users can view progress over time and adjust strategies for better productivity.

## Challenges Faced

- **Integrating Game Logic:** Balancing Tetris mechanics with task management features was a unique and challenging task.
- **Backend Integration:** Setting up secure user authentication and efficient data storage with Appwrite.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Ensuring seamless synchronization between task completion and the Tetris board.

## Future Enhancements

- **Collaborative Boards:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on shared boards.
- **Leaderboard:** Introduce a global leaderboard to foster competition and motivation.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Provide insights into productivity patterns and offer actionable suggestions.
- **Custom Themes:** Add user-selectable themes for personalization.

## Deployment

Tasktris is currently available as a prototype. It showcases my technical skills and is a work in progress with potential for further development.
